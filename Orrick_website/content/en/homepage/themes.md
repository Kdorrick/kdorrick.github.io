<div style="text-align: justify">I work at the intersection of social and ecological dimensions in conservation. My research interests cover three overlapping themes, all of which are present in my work. These are:

<li> Theoretical Ecology and Social Science
<li> Applied Social-Ecological Systems
<li> Human-Wildlife Interactions </li>


<br>

### Theoretical Ecology and Social Science
While I am driven and fueled by field-based research and collaboration across multiple stakeholders, I also have a strong interest in ecological and social theory, particularly how we can use theoretical ecological and social science and individual-based modeling to help bridge the gap between theoretical and applied science.

### Applied Social-Ecological Systems

     Broadly, I am interested in social-ecological systems. Using ecological and anthropological theories and expand them to examine social-ecological landscapes; thus my work spans across qualitative and quantitative disciplines and methodologies. I am focused on the multi-species and multi-predator interactions and space use in a human-dominated (and livestock-dominated) landscape.

### Human-Wildlife Interactions

Inclusively-driven conservation is at the center for my work. In particular, I am interested in how to develop conservation projects which are scientifically rigorous and fit the needs and desires of local communities. Using this approach, I am interested in human-wildlife interactions, which include conflicts.
