I'm Kaggie and I'm a conservation scientist. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at University of California, Berkeley with Arthur Middleton and Justin Brashares as part of the [California Wolf Project](wildlife.berkeley.edu/cawolfproject/). I'm a PhD graduate of the [Yale School of the Environment](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=School+of+the+environment+yale&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and worked in the [Schmitz lab](http://schmitz.environment.yale.edu/) and with the [Dove lab](https://environment.yale.edu/profile/dove). I'm also a conservation associate and board member of [Round River Conservation Studies](https://www.roundriver.org). My research examines the human-wildlife interface in social-ecological landscapes. I bridge ecological and social science theories in the hopes to advance our ability to do conservation science. I am particularly interested in the practices of people, animals, and domestic species.
