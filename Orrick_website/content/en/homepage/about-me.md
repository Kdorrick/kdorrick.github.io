I've worked across a number of different landscapes, including but not limited to: small mammal occurrence along a habitat and elevation gradient on a [geographically-isolated mountain](https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/57280); feeding ecology and energetics of large carnivores, including [cheetah](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1256424); [community-based monitoring of herbivore communities](https://www.roundriver.org/where-we-work/southern-africa/botswana-okavango-delta/botswana-maps-and-publications/) across the the Okavango Delta; human-wildlife interactions near the Central Kalahari desert; and the natural recolonization of [wolves in California](wildlife.berkeley.edu/cawolfproject/).
