<div style="text-align: justify">At the California Wolf Project, we lead efforts to assess wolf impacts on people and sympatric species, collaborate with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), and engage with local ranchers to develop sustainable strategies for coexistence.  As the Director of the project, I oversee all research and partnerships.
