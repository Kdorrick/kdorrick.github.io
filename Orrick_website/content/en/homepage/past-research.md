I have been so fortunate to work in many places.

<div style="text-align: justify">Upon completion of my undergraduate degree in Maine, I spent three years in South Africa working on a private game reserve, conducting large carnivore research as well as managing a small mammal satellite research camp on a geographically-isolated mountain range. When I left in 2015 I had gone from intern to the project manager.

I received a MA in Conservation Biology at Columbia University in 2015 with a thesis focused on anthropogenic features that influence elephant movement. During that time I also developed my spatial analysis skills and love for Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing. I was also a graduate student researcher for Professor Don Melnick conducting preliminary analysis of forest loss using remote sensing and GIS for the Rainforest Standard, a carbon credit program, to determine appropriate protected areas for forest loss evaluation.  




Since graduating from Columbia University, I have been affiliated with Round River Conservation Studies's work in Botswana.

     From 2015-2018 I managed and led the RRCS US-student abroad program and the development of community-based wildlife monitoring project. This work included herbivore and bird monitoring, community escort guide training and assisting with the Northern Botswana Ecological Assessment and Decision Support Tool. I simultaneously ran the research program while also working with 5 – 9 American undergraduates as part of their abroad program with RRCS. We lived in tents in the field for three months at a time while working with community members, teaching five college-level courses, conducting research and cooking over an open fire. 


From 2018-2024, I was responsible for the design and implementation of research and conservation efforts of RRCS in the Makgadikgadi region of Botswana. I maintained partnerships with the University of Botswana’s Okavango Research Institute and Department of Wildlife and National Parks, assisted with grant applications, while also being the main project coordinator on the ground. Much of my work and my motivation comes from the experiences and knowledge I gained in Botswana.

From 2024 to present I have been working at UC Berkeley as part of the California Wolf Project. We examine the social and ecological dimensions of the natural wolf recovery occurring right now in California. This includes studying the impact of wolves on simpatric species, livestock producers, and general wolf ecology across this unique state. We work in close partnership and collaboration with California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
