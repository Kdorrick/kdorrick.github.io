The research for my dissertation aimed to understand the interplay between wildlife, cattle, and humans and map its resulting coexistence landscape in Central Sub-district of Boteti West between Makgadikgadi Pans National Park (MPNP) and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), Botswana. The area is predicted to be the highest priority corridor for lions in all of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Area, as well as one of the highest human-wildlife conflict areas in the country. However, there has never been a wildlife survey to confirm the use of this area as a corridor or determine how, when, or where wildlife move through this human-dominated landscape. Specifically, I am interested in the practices of people, of wildlife, and of livestock.



I examine the landscape using three methodologies:

1) Habitat suitability and wildlife occurrence using a combination of camera trap surveys and satellite imagery; 
2) Human perceptions of wildlife using household surveys and participatory mapping to understand human land use patterns;
 3) Cattle movement and land use through GPS units.

This information collectively portrays an inclusive, social-ecological system that can provide nuanced understanding of how to achieve human-cattle-wildlife coexistence while incorporating participation from local communities in CT8. This work was in partnership and collaboration with the tourism organization [Natural Selection](https://naturalselection.travel/?gclid=CjwKCAiA0JKfBhBIEiwAPhZXDwErBEMzmnYx-DHIhrq58rIoKVPGtQFYrdRpYFubaGJNOAl2tZS0bxoCM44QAvD_BwE), the conservation NGO [Round River Conservation Studies](roundriver.org), and the [University of Botswana's Okavango Research Institute](https://www.ori.ub.bw/).
